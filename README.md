# image-rotator
Small script to rotate all images within a folder

Place this file in the same directory that holds the folder containg the images to be rotated.
Run the program.
The rotated images will be placed in a folder of your choosing.

Yeah, you can mass-rotate photos on your desktop file explorer, but this could come in handy on your phone.
Depending on what environment your phone is using, the instance of the script may not be running where you saved it.
As such, you will need to change the directory of where the instance is running.
